Doc Docs
========


Tutorial
--------

The tutorial notebooks need to be synced manually for now. When changes are made, the notebook
has to be converted to .rst format, and placed under docs/quick/tutorial.rst.

The command to make the convertion is:

>>> jupyter nbconvert --to rst tutorial.ipynb
>>> sed -i 's/ipython3/python/g' tutorial.rst

Builds
------

As of now, builds are automatically done by readthedocs.io and published to parsl.readthedocs.io
upon git commits.

Local Builds
============

>>> make html

Dev_Docs
--------

The developer documentation for the codebase is embedded in the codebase and imported through
docs/devguide/dev_docs.rst. So do not be alarmed to see no text within the .rst file.
